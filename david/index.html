          <p>
            I grew up in Upstate New York and attended the Nazarene church in Owego, NY for most of my childhood.
            I felt a call to ministry in my early high school years, and because of that, chose to attend Eastern Nazarene College after graduating high school.
            <br /><br />
            I received by Bachelor of Arts in Religion from ENC and then went on to receive a Master of Arts in Pastoral Counseling from ENC with clinical work at Massachusetts General Hospital.
            After graduating, I became a youth and associate pastor at Uxbridge Church of the Nazarene.
            <br /><br />
            After several years in Uxbridge, I was called to Pennsylvania to serve as the lead pastor at New Freedom Trail Church of the Nazarene, where I have served since.
            While in Pennsylvania, I also served as a therapist for several organizations until opening my own practice, <a href="http://lightandlifecounseling.com" target="_blank">Light and Life Christian Counseling.</a>
            As a part of Light and Life, I have partnered with LifePath Christian Ministries, an organization ministering to the homeless and hurting. 
            I provide counseling for individuals who are trying to put their lives back together.

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Family Life</b></h5>
          <p>
            My wife, Karen (Hammer) grew up on Long Island and was a member of the East Rockway Church of the Nazarene. 
            She attended ENC, where we met, and we got married shortly after we both graduated.
            Karen is a piano instructor/accompanist and enjoys composing music as a hobby. 
            Together, we have two sons. 
            Our oldest, Christopher, an ENC graduate, is employed as a chemist and recently married Hannah, who is studying to be a nurse. 
            Our younger son, Caleb, is a senior at ENC with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
            We also have a thirteen year old American Eskimo dog, Yuki.
            <br/><br />
            Karen and I enjoy singing together, going on adventures to historical sites, and vacationing at the beach. 
            We also enjoy singing with my sister, Sue, and Karen's brother, Jim, who are also married. 
            We call our group, "Rejoice and Sing" and mostly minister in churches, camp meetings, and retreats.
